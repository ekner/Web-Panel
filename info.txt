Summary:

Navigate to websites in the sidebar.

Detailed description:

With this extension, you can surf to any* website in the sidebar.

Features:
 - Bookmarking. Bookmarks are stored in "Web Panel extension" in "Imported bookmarks".
 - Auto reload. This can be useful if you for example follow a live score system in the sidebar, but the page doesn't update the data automatically.
 - Mobile mode. This will make some websites use their mobile version, which often fits better in the Web Panel.
 - Light theme, dark theme and Opera GX theme.
 - Search engines: Ecosia, Startpage.com and Aol. You can also add custom ones.
 - Page zoom.

*Note: Some sites will not work in the sidebar. If you want to know why, you can have a more detailed explanation here: https://github.com/ekner/Web-Panel/wiki/Why-are-some-pages-not-displayed%3F. Some of these are:
 - vk.com
 - google.com (Only Google search; other services such as Keep and Calendar works)
 - yahoo.com
 - bing.com
 - duckduckgo.com
 - yandex.com

If you want to use one of the websites above for searching, you may use a regular tab for searching,
and then open the correct page by pressing the left arrow button in the bottom bar.
